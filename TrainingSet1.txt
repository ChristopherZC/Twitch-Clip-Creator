[3:55:53] <galaron> LMAO
[3:55:54] <Funak123> If your country is too unstable for you to play professional dota, then maybe you should not play professional dota. or youknow, move somewhere else?
[3:55:56] <adorableuseless> how come 1 dc and the others not ? if they ready to play on qual they should prepare everything!
[3:56:03] <twitchchatllul> @prep0nderator yeah. they don't. just suck it up, because their country is shit, which is what their forefathers made it to be
[3:56:10] <stephanrozen> Midas had this game 100% with such a strong teamfight, this is actually not fair. But its not the other teams fault I guess.
[3:56:10] <emetophobe> @Funak123 FailFish the first option is doable, moving to another country isnt
[3:56:12] <Scalene> if they have infrastructure problems they should become engineers and politicians and fix it Kappa
[3:56:14] <Doc_Awes> @Funak123 yes just move somewhere thats realy easy for a t2 dota player Kappa
[3:56:16] <TriHard_from_Japan> has given away 10 free subscriptions to ogadotapit. Type !sub to see if you have won.

[3:59:33] <suppomen1> @loki1379 2 hours
[3:59:35] <leozera89> @Doc_Awes when they were dqed there was proof from the macro used on huskar and meepo matches, now this dirty unpause... i mean, there's no surprise
[3:59:36] <emetophobe> american internet would be like this if Ajit Pai and the FCC had their way GabeN
[3:59:38] <Silent765u> Feelsbadman for midas
[3:59:43] <ovoarchie> Gg
[3:59:53] <adorableuseless> is it so hard to build mini bootcamp and share a stable internet connection ?
[3:59:55] <sheeps321> No ads FeelsGoodMan
[4:00:01] <riicsg> I really hope TA dont win this qualy
[4:00:04] <suppomen1> dirty unpause, lol this kid LUL
[4:00:06] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 dirty unpause? its the rules, theres a set time then you are supposed to unpause regardless of the situtation
[4:00:06] <egzius> @emetophobe don't need FCC, when geban lose money to Epic store and shuts down half of servers
[4:00:06] <Scalene> adorableuseless in some places, yes
[4:00:09] <SnoWolf187> how they even qualify to play lol
[4:00:09] <loki1379> @suppomen1 wow funiest guy on planet right here
[4:00:12] <stephanrozen> They must be hella mad, having a game in a bag like that and losing cause one player dced.
[4:00:23] <SnoWolf187> lol

[4:00:34] <leozera89> @Doc_Awes there's no honor in winning a match 5v4, just sayin its dirty, not illegal
[4:00:39] <pbjester2> aol you have mail lookin ass
[4:00:42] <XpressN> KKonas LUL
[4:00:47] <Shisui_T> how does Ajit Pai manage to be unlikable even with his giant mug? 4Head
[4:00:48] <SnoWolf187> ez money for team midas lol
[4:01:01] <riicsg> @doc_awes Yeah, now imagine VP, Secret or any other team doing the same thing. They unpaused cause they suck at playing dota.
[4:01:07] <twitchchatllul> @leozera89 dirty unpause LUL rules are rules which is something 3rd world country does not adhere to, thus they are in the state they are in.
[4:01:09] <Silent765u> hopefully they pull back up just cause they kinda didnt deserve a loss like that
[4:01:10] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 What TP did isn't dishonorable its the rules. It's not dirty in anyway. You cant hold up the entire qualifiers over a game.
[4:01:11] <SnoWolf187> bet on other team and tadaaaannnn real midas ez money hahaha
[4:01:12] <emetophobe> @riicsg stop making shit up
[4:01:19] <Gimpy_joe> BibleThump
[4:01:22] <loki1379> @suppomen1 nah just dying of laughter sick jokes
[4:01:30] <Doc_Awes> If you don';t uphold the rules then people would abuse the shit out of that
[4:01:35] <emetophobe> there are rules, this has happened before.. all teams have X minutes to be a lobby, and they have X minutes worth of total pause time per game
[4:01:40] <emetophobe> this has existed for years
[4:01:42] <Scalene> comeback in game 2 pls BlessRNG
[4:01:42] <leozera89> @twitchchatllul rules or not, i mean there's no surprise when this kind of attitude comes from a disqualified team who used macros to win in the past
[4:01:43] <Doc_Awes> ^
[4:01:44] <stephanrozen> 3rd World countries are the way they are cause of their shitty politicians.
[4:01:57] <Silent765u> Midas comeback on games 2 and 3
[4:02:07] <twitchchatllul> @leozera89 my ass, another other team would have done the same in Europe, NA or elsewhere
[4:02:12] <EzDotoEzlyfe> This is the way it is in pubs. Why would it be any different in a pro game
[4:02:13] <adorableuseless> well shit happen, that just happened, just move on
[4:02:15] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 Its not an attitude. TP has to unpause, as does Midas. It's not a choice. Any team would do the same.
[4:02:24] <stephanrozen> Exactly shit happens.

[4:02:27] <leozera89> @Doc_Awes as I said, ethics differs from rules. I dont find it acceptable in any way. A dirty team once, a dirty team forever
[4:02:27] <emetophobe> the admins are the ones to say to unpause FailFish
[4:02:27] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 One mistake doesnt mean your entire team is dirty and has no ethics.
[4:02:32] <stephanrozen> and they waited like 10 mins
[4:02:33] <twitchchatllul> @leozera89 no one is gonna wait for you for god knows how long for a game and affect his/her ife
[4:02:33] <stephanrozen> or more
[4:02:45] <stephanrozen> They have to just move on
[4:02:46] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 It is ethical to unpause.
[4:02:47] <stephanrozen> play the next agme
[4:02:48] <Scalene> guys we don't even know if admin told them to unpause LUL
[4:02:56] <Doc_Awes> Admin shouldn't have to.
[4:02:58] <Doc_Awes> Rules are rules.
[4:03:02] <leozera89> @twitchchatllul i see u can maintain a fairly poor level of conversation, u must be dirty just like them
[4:03:04] <Silent765u> No ones fault really. Not wven the rules‚Äô fault. The rule is totally fair
[4:03:10] <riicsg> @twitchchatllul only in CIS or SEA, maybe small team in Europe... big organizations would never do that. Is not unfair, just not a deserved win
[4:03:13] <twitchchatllul> @leozera89 so low level LUL
[4:03:15] <yaddayaddas> @doc_awes consciously cheating knowing it is wrong /= mistake
[4:03:15] <stephanrozen> I mean if I wait patiently like 10-15 mins and no news. I expect a unpause
[4:03:17] <suppomen1> @leozera89 should wait that DS until next year LUL
[4:03:17] <emetophobe> @leozera89 keep your bigoted views to yourself FailFish
[4:03:42] <twitchchatllul> @riicsg did you watch Kansel's qualifier? he keep unpausing after 10mins, that's EU fyi
[4:03:49] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 According to Atuun he didn';t think it was wrong. While obviously a moral oversight there is a reason valve did not ban atuun or anyone from TP from valve events.
[4:03:56] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 He made a mistake and got punished.
[4:04:01] <leozera89> @emetophobe bigoted? never underleved anyone opinions here, just gave mine
[4:04:12] <Coolwingxxx> Internet Issue fixed. His sister was streaming her Candy Crush game. No bandwidth. It‚Äôs all good now üëçüèº
[4:04:16] <Scalene> not sure you know what bigoted means but ok
[4:04:21] <Silent765u> LOL
[4:04:25] <Doc_Awes> If he thought it was cheating he wouldn't have posted a goddamn facebook video showing how to do it @leozera89
[4:04:27] <pbjester2> people who mad about Midas are mad cause they lost their lunch money lmao
[4:04:33] <emetophobe> *having or revealing an obstinate belief in the superiority of one's own opinions and a prejudiced intolerance of the opinions of others.

[4:04:42] <twitchchatllul> @riicsg Fyi, big teams don't face some teams with shit infrastructure.
[4:04:44] <riicsg> @doc_awes Atun used macros, it was clearly intentional. He wast banned cause valve never sair it was illegal
[4:04:44] <emetophobe> im quite aware of what a bigot is, twitch is filled with them
[4:04:47] <leozera89> @Doc_Awes he confessed the use, he did not say he was innocent
[4:04:55] <Scalene> emetophobe I was talking to him not you SeemsGood
[4:05:02] <emetophobe> sorry monkaS
[4:05:05] <Scalene> monkaS
[4:05:21] <riicsg> @twitchchatllul midas is just a stack team
[4:05:27] <twitchchatllul> @leozera89 low level are you biased fools who used past history to put down others.
[4:05:35] <Doc_Awes> @leozera89 If he thought he was cheating would he post a public video on how to do it during the qualis? Also again, valve did not ban him. Valve recongnized it was a dumb kid who made a mistake.
[4:05:36] <leozera89> @Doc_Awes Sir, i liked to discuss our point of views as gentleman, shoutout to you
[4:05:41] <pbjester2> stack team with full of pausible players

[4:07:10] <twitchchatllul> @leozera89 continue being biased and calling everyone who disagree with you as low level. Guess what, Valve agrees to unpausing. Maybe stop playing Dota, it ain't on your level. LMAO 3rd world dog

[4:14:46] <FuryEnergy> wtf is up with predators support picks
[4:14:51] <stephanrozen> now they have undiying i'd say thats off
[4:14:52] <FuryEnergy> both games
[4:14:56] <stephanrozen> ursa mid, and morph safe
[4:14:57] <gregoriusmagnus> Midas have good lockdown... it isn't a free morph game at all
[4:14:57] <Scalene> Undying in 2k19 LUL
[4:15:03] <straightgrizzley> @FuryEnergy SA thats why
[4:15:13] <sheeps321> get doom for complete morph lockdown
[4:15:13] <stephanrozen> Tombstone lvl 4 is gud.
[4:15:29] <merthins> Really dislike Undying
[4:15:30] <Scalene> Pause for Elevated üò°

[4:17:29] <jCOcABo> atun macro pepeLaugh
[4:17:30] <not_hat> dusa is easily the hardest carry in this game. midas wins
[4:17:36] <sheeps321> Not alot of disable for morph
[4:17:39] <sage1027> what symbol did you type scalene?
[4:17:43] <stephanrozen> Cmon caster, they have wyntern wyven what a better lockdown than that ulti.

[4:19:36] <sage1027> first 10 kills
[4:19:47] <Scalene> ah
[4:20:01] <Silent765u> @popowatsom ember team
[4:20:09] <stephanrozen> The problem with TP line up is that they need so much farm
[4:20:17] <Coolwingxxx> Frank the Tank
[4:20:23] <Scalene> ember can do a lot with some levels
[4:20:27] <merthins> 3 Cores is hella greedy imo
[4:20:31] <gregoriusmagnus> let me burn all my regen before the creeps even spawn
[4:20:34] <dadyM1> this ursa
[4:20:36] <Morimoriforest> what? lmao. dire needs more farm than rad line up dude
[4:20:43] <not_hat> everytime i see Frank playing I imagine Frank from it's always sunny playing LUL
[4:20:51] <stephanrozen> Only the medusa tbh
[4:20:57] <sheeps321> Bottom is free farm for morph though
[4:20:57] <stephanrozen> LF is good without that much farm
[4:21:08] <stephanrozen> Lifestealer.
[4:21:11] <Morimoriforest> so is morph and ursa what's your point lmao
[4:21:13] <Scalene> LiFestealer
[4:21:20] <sheeps321> LF needs farm..
[4:21:27] <suppomen1> @morimoriforest VS,WW only need 6 and boots to effective... can't say that with undying, nyx
[4:21:27] <stephanrozen> That this game is gonna depend a lot on early plays
[4:21:29] <jCOcABo> danny devito ursa Pog
[4:21:36] <Morimoriforest> LS needs farm, dusa needs massive farm, CW useless without blink
[4:21:37] <stephanrozen> who gets the advantage
[4:21:44] <stephanrozen> truth.
[4:21:47] <Coolwingxxx> Undying players NotLikeThis
[4:21:54] <not_hat> both sides are ultra greed. the question is who can get an early advantage
[4:21:59] <„Ç≠„Éû„É≠„Éâ> this centaurs lane is fucked
[4:22:02] <Scalene> Prada's sponsor is sponsoring me too :)
